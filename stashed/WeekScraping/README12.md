In this assignment, you'll have more freedom to experiment but also that requires you to take more initiative. We want you to bring in as much as you've learned with CodeLab, but also to decide what is relevant to this assignment.

For this project, working in pairs, we want you to find a website that has public domain materials (whether project gutenberg, wikipedia, etc... ).

1. Get the public domain materials from that site with web scraping

2. Using python libraries and methods, and DO SOMETHING with the sources.
    Some ideas:
    - remix the sources in a way that transforms the public domain sources in a new way (what ways can you remix things to change their context productively?)
    - analyze the sources to find patterns (think about what patterns you might be interested in?)
    - explore metadata of the sources (can you group these sources in a different ways through metadata? )

3. Present what you've created on an html page and push it up to Github.

**FULL DISCLOSURE: We want you to do your best but this is a hard assignment!!** 

Don't worry so much about getting things perfect. Focus on trying to scope something that is doable. You can always improve things later and iterate on your ideas.
