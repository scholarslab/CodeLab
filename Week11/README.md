## Assignment

Show and Tell! I'm turning things over to all of you next week. Find an interesting Python package/library, either on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or just through searching on the Internet. It can be something that you think could be useful to your research interests or really anything that you think is neat. Write some code to demonstrate what it does and tell us how you think it could be useful or why it appeals to you.
