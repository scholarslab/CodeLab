## Lesson

1. What is data?
2. How to data
3. Basic data representations

## Resources
[Python data types cheatsheet](types_cheatsheet.md)

## New Terms
* **Analog**: Relating to continuous numerical values of infitesimal granularity
* **Binary**: Base-2 numeral system, consisting only of 0 and 1. Counting up from 0, the binary numbers are: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000...
* **Boolean**: A data type that has two possible values: True and False. These are often used with and associated with the binary values 1 and 0. Boolean values in Python are often used in conditionals and loops (which we'll talk about in the future)
* **Digital**: Relating to discrete numerical systems
* **Floating Point Number (Float)**: A number with a decimal point (e.g. `3.0` rather than `3`). Because computers use binary numbers internally to represent numbers with decimal points, we often run into very small and unexpected rounding errors when using floats.
* **Integer**: A positive, negative, or zero whole number (e.g. `3` rather than `3.0`).
* **String**: Text data. We can think of it as a list of this as a list of characters. For example, `"Hazel"[2]` is `'z'`.

## Homework for Week 3

## Do:

1. This is an exercise in some of the more fundamental work skills of the Digital Humanities: let's do some searching and some back of the envelope estimation. From a purely energy perspective, is it actually a good idea to print out and delete all our digital documents rather than letting them stay digital? We don't have to be exact. Feel free to make assumptions that you can argue for.

2. Let's flex our algorithmic thinking muscles some more. Write out in plain English an algorithm to sort a deck of cards.

3. And: Write out in plain English an algorithm for a cashier to find exact change.
