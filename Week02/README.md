## New Terms
* **Binary**: Base-2 numeral system, consisting only of 0 and 1. Counting up from 0, the binary numbers are: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000...
* **Boolean**: A data type that has two possible values: True and False. These are often used with and associated with the binary values 1 and 0. Boolean values in Python are often used in conditionals and loops (which we'll talk about in the future)
* **Floating Point Number (Float)**: A number with a decimal point (e.g. `3.0` rather than `3`). Because computers use binary numbers internally, we often run into very small and unexpected rounding errors when using floats.
* **Function**: A piece of code that does a specific task. Larger functions can be broken down into smaller ones. Familiar built-in Python functions include `print` and `len`. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and then can be "called" (executed) by other code at will later on using the `function_name(parameter)` format.
* **Index**: The position of a value inside of a list or other sequence, typically referenced using square brackets. Python is "zero-indexed", which means that the first index of a list is 0. `numbers[0]` references the *first* value of the list `numbers` whereas `numbers[3]` is the *4th* value. So if `numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]`, then `numbers[0]` is `1` and `numbers[3]` is 4.
* **Integer**: A whole number (e.g. `3` rather than `3.0`).
* **List**: A useful built-in Python data structure that represents a linear and ordered collection of data (i.e. data arranged in a row, in a certain order). We define lists using square brackets (e.g. `numbers = [1,2,3]` or `numbers=[]` to create an empty list). We can access an individual item inside of a list using square brackets and its list index (e.g. `numbers[2]`) or a range of indices (e.g. `numbers[2:5]` or `numbers[3:]`).
* **String**: Text data. We can think of it as a list of this as a list of characters. For example, `"Hazel"[2]` is `'z'`.
* **Variable**: A container for data. Variables let us squirrel away a piece of data using a variable name and the assignment operator (`a = 5`) and then refer back to it later (`a + 10`). Any piece of data that we want to keep track of, we have to store away as a variable.
