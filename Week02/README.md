# Week 2: Introduction to Data

![Hazel!](assets/sleeping_hazel.jpeg)

## Lesson
[Lesson document](intro_data.md)
1. What is data?
2. How to data
3. Basic data representations

## New Terms
* **Analog**: Relating to continuous numerical values of infitesimal granularity
* **Binary**: Base-2 numeral system, consisting only of 0 and 1. Counting up from 0, the binary numbers are: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000...
* **Boolean**: A data type that has two possible values: True and False. These are often used with and associated with the binary values 1 and 0. Boolean values in Python are often used in conditionals and loops (which we'll talk about in the future)
* **Digital**: Relating to discrete numerical systems
* **Floating Point Number (Float)**: A number with a decimal point (e.g. `3.0` rather than `3`). Because computers use binary numbers internally to represent numbers with decimal points, we often run into very small and unexpected rounding errors when using floats.
* **Integer**: A positive, negative, or zero whole number (e.g. `3` rather than `3.0`).
* **String**: Text data. We can think of it as a list of this as a list of characters. For example, `"Hazel"[2]` is `'z'`.

## Homework to do before Week 3

## Do:

1. Let's flex our algorithmic thinking muscles some more. Write out in plain English an algorithm to sort a deck of cards.

2. And: Write out in plain English an algorithm for a cashier to find exact change.
