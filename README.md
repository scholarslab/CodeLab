Welcome to Codelab, a course on the foundations of coding and digital humanities technics designed by the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia Library for the Praxis Fellowship.

Codelab is broadly divided into two sections: _Codelab Fundamentals_, which introduces basic computing, data, and algorithmic concepts without coding directly, and _Codelab Code Lab_, which uses Python to teach practical programming skills.
