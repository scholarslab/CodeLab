Welcome to a course on the foundations of coding and digital humanities technics, designed by the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia Library for the Praxis Fellowship.

Codelab is divided into two broad sections: *Codelab Fundamentals*, which introduces basic computing, data, and algorithmic concepts without direct coding, and *Codelab Code Lab*, which uses Python to teach practical programming skills.
