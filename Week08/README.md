## Homework

### Assignment 0

Write a Python program to implement our instructions for returning exact change from Week 2. Something that looks like this...

```python
DENOMINATIONS = [100,20,10,5,1,0.25,0.1,0.5,0.01]

def change(cost, payment):
    # your code here
    return list_of_change

# Test cases
print(change(5,2.55))
print(change(2.55,5))
print(change(5,5))
print(change(0,5))
```
