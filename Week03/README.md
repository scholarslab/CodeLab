## Homework to do before Week 4

## Do:

1. Let's continue to practice algorithmic thinking. Write out in plain English an algorithm to guess whether a text represents English, French, Portugese, Urdu, Simplified Chinese, or "other".

2. Manually write out an XML document that contains the data in your CV.

3. Watch ["Git Explained in 100 Seconds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) without paying too close attention for now to all the commands that get brought up. We're going to do way more Git stuff next week, so don't worry about the details for now!
