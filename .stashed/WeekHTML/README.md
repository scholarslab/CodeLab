Even though I've lost custody of all of you these two weeks, I'm still going to assign homework.

## Assignment
### Part Alpha

Write a script to download the list of Scholars' Lab blog posts (https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/) and then print out a list of how many blog posts each author has.

The page highlights the most recent four posts. These are optional because they don't conform to the standard structure of the majority of older posts below.

You can assume there aren't people with identical names. You don't have to sort the results, but it might be useful to figure out how such a thing could be done. 

### Part Bravo

If you wanted to work on more HTML/CSS over break, you could take a swing and mocking up a personal website for yourself. I’m (Brandon) happy to answer questions and also to help you get up and running with the thing live if you desire after break (or sooner if you’re keen on it). I highly recommend drawing what you want first and then trying to implement your drawing with HTML/CSS. And if you want inspiration in the form of my first attempt, here is a link to the [site I made in Praxis back in the day](http://walshbr.com/old-site/).

### Part Charlie

Have a good break and keep on hacking!
