#### [What's HTML?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#What_is_HTML)

Let's try writing an html file. Create a file in your workspace called `first_page.html`. Open the file in VSCode and add the following code:
```
<p>My first page!</p>
```
Save it and open the file in Chrome, what do you see? What happened to our element's tags? Let's right click on our page and select `inspect`. What we're using is called the Chrome DevTools Console.[You can find more info about Chrome Devtools Console here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)

Let's take a look at some of the more common HTML tags that we can use to create HTML elements [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) 

What tag are we currently using? 
How would we make it into an HTML heading?

HTML elements can also have [attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#Attributes)

Let's try using the `anchor` tag and `href` attribute to create an HTML element that links to `https://twitter.com/`

You can find a list of HTML attributes here [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp)

We'll be going over more HTML and the web next week, let's hop back to [web scrapping](intro_web_scraping.md)
