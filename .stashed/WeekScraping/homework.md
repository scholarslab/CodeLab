Let's continue with the Scholars Lab Blog page

1. Find a way to get every link on the page
2. Figure out how to only store the text of the link, not the tags
3. Only keep links that are to blog posts and not to images or pages on the site
4. Write the list of links to a text file

**BONUS**

Using the instructions for reading urls with the `requests` library, figure out how to read the link for each blog post using the links you've already selected from the Scholars' Lab Blog page. (**hint** remember for loops are your friend!)

If you get that far, then try to extract from each blog post the author and date it was written, using a new BeautifulSoup instance. Remember to use the developer console in Chrome to inspect the blog page to figure out what tags you need.
