### Assignment 0

Take your steps for making exact change from week 2 and convert it to Python code. Use something like this as a starting point:

```python
DENOMINATIONS = [100,20,10,5,1,0.25,0.1,0.05,0.01]
def exact_change(cost,payment):
    # your code here
    return change_list

#test cases
print(exact_change(5,2.55))
print(exact_change(2.55,5))
print(exact_change(5,5))
print(exact_change(0,5))
```
