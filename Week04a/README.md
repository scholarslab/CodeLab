## Homework for Week 4

Pair program these with a buddy! Pair programming is fun and productive unless you do it wrong. According to formal logic, this does not necessarily mean that doing it wrong cannot also be fun and productive, but it does mean that if it isn't fun and productive, you aren't doing it right.


### Coding assignment 1a

Convert your own Pig Latin code from last week into a function in this form:

```python
# Your function definition here

print(pig_latin(input("Enter input: ")))
```

### Coding assignment 1b

Modify your code in part 2a to detect whether the input contains more than one word. If the input has one word, print the Pig Latin version. If the input has multiple words, only print the Pig Latin for the first word. The [Python documentation for a particualr string method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) will be very useful here!

### Coding assignment 1c

Modify your code from part 2b to account for the special case where the first letter of the word is a vowel.
