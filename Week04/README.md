## Homework for Week 4

Try pair programming with a different buddy this time. Or else try to pair program rather than not doing it.

### Assignment 1: FizzBuzz

We might have skipped over too much basic loop and conditional syntax. Write a program that takes as input a number and then plays the [FizzBuzz game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) until that number. This is a classic programming puzzle and, helpfully, Wikipedia has a list of solutions, including one in Python. But if you use it, be prepared to explain how it works in the next Codelab.

Example:
```python
# We're not going to worry about invalid input for this...
i = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Your code here
# Example output: "1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7"
# (all on one line or on multiple lines are both fine)
```

Hint:
There's a number of built-in operators in Python that may be helpful for this excercise which are [covered in the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html). You'll probably want to use a loop of some kind, so I would suggest reviewing the Python [Control Flow documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html).

### Assignment 2: Git Practice

I've created a git repository on the Scholars' Lab account that has a single markdown text file at [https://github.com/scholarslab/gitpractice](https://github.com/scholarslab/gitpractice). Hopefully, you should have access to this repository by the end of this session. Clone this file to your computer, answer the three original seed questions, then add a new question of your own for your fellows to answer. Check back later in the week for new questions and answer them so that, hopefully, by the time we meet again, we'll have a fully-filled-out and, let's say, quixotically personal questionaire for the entire cohort.


### Assignment 3: Put it together

Take your answer to assignment 1 and push it to a new repository on Github under your account.
