## Welcome to CodeLab

Hi there. Welcome to CodeLab. This is Shane, writing from various times in the past (and occasionally Zoe, writing generally from even longer ago). I'm a younger, slightly less experienced, probably slightly more handsome version of Shane from right now, so you'll have to excuse me if I'm unclear or rambly or factually wrong. Don't blame it on Shane Prime. I'm sure he knows better by now. The two of us (Shane and Zoe) and the Scholars' Lab staff created Code Lab back in 2018 as a way to ensure that that year's Praxis cohort would have a good technical foundation on which to build their DH projects and later humanities careers and I've been doing it ever since. Hopefully, you'll be getting all this from a presentation that current-timeline-me has given, is giving, or will shortly give.

This first week is mostly setting up your computer with the software that we'll use for the rest of the semester and getting started with using your computer through the command line.

## CodeLab Resources
* [Environment Setup Instructions](environment_setup.md)
* [Command Line Cheatsheet](commandline.md)

## New Terms
(Also see: [Command Line Glossary](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab/blob/master/Week01/commandline.md#glossary)
* **Algorithm**: An unambiguous and well-defined set of instructions. A computer program is an algorithm, but so is a cookbook recipe. There's really nothing special about algorithms, nothing inherently mysterious or sinister. The algorithm is a simple idea, but computers have allowed them to grow to incomprehensible levels of complexity.
* **Programming Language**: A particular kind of computer code in which programs are written. There are other kinds of computer languages (such as markup languages like HTML that are used to describe a document); programming languages instruct a computer to ingest input, produce output, manipulate data, calculate equations, and the such. Many thousands of programming languages exist, often tailored for specialized applications or types of computers.
* **Python**: One popular programming language originally released in 1991. Python is extremely common in digital humanities and adjacent fields like data science because it is easy for non-programmers to learn and has a large library (both built-in and third-party) to perform common tasks. Python 3 is the current major version, which is not completely backward-compatible with the long-running previous version, Python 2.

## Homework for Week 1

* Schedule a 1 on 1 with me to talk about your dreams, your discontents, and your computer. We'll also use this time to set up your [development environment](environment_setup.md). 
* Afterward, complete Ian Milligan and James Baker, "Introduction to the Bash Command Line," The Programming Historian 3 (2014), [https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash). This is an introduction to the Bash shell, which will serve well enough as an introduction to other shells like Zsh as well.
  * For Windows users, skip the "Windows Only: Installing Git Bash" section - we're going a different direction. Use the VSCode Terminal or Windows Terminal, as recommended in the Code Lab environment setup.
* Set up an account at [Github](http://www.github.com) and post your username on the Slack praxis channel.

### Readings

If you haven't read through the pre-readings, now's a good time to do that:
* [Section 1](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#the-man-in-the-taupe-blazer) and [section 2](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#lets-begin) from Paul Ford's *What is Code?*, Businessweek June 11 2015
* Ben Schmidt's ["Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#ch48)

Hopefully I'll have passed out copies of Julia Evans's lovely [So You Want to be a Wizard](https://wizardzines.com/zines/wizard/) zine. That's something that's written for someone who is already a programmer, but it's useful for you to skim through now to gleen some meta-strategies for navigating tech which will hopefully be useful for down the road, when you have a few `for loops` under your belt.

For a bit of counter-programming, Miriam Posner's ["Some things to think about before you exhort everyone to code"](https://miriamposner.com/blog/some-things-to-think-about-before-you-exhort-everyone-to-code/) is good to think about (and perhaps even to critique).
